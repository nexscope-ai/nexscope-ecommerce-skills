# Ruiguan Image Compliance Detection API Reference

## Request Specification

- **Endpoint**: `${NEXSCOPE_PROXY_BASE}/api/v1/tools/research/ruiguan/gunPartsSearch`
- **Method**: POST, Content-Type: application/json
- **Authentication**: Header `Authorization: <api_key>`; read api_key from `nexscope_AGENT_API_KEY` or `nexscopeAGENT_API_KEY`. If neither is configured, follow the authentication and credits guidance in SKILL.md.

## Request Parameters

POST Body (JSON):

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|------|------|
| imageUrl | string | Yes | URL of the product image to check (maximum 1000 characters) |


## Nexscope response envelope

These research endpoints return a platform object with numeric `code`, nullable `msg`, and business `data`. Only outer `code: 0` means success; `200`, string codes, missing codes, and HTTP 200 alone do not. A nonzero code is a platform error: show `msg` and do not interpret the payload as a successful result.

`msg` preserves the upstream message when available; Chinese messages are translated to English by Nexscope. A successful response without a message has `msg: null`. Do not infer success or retry behavior from the message text. Root provider `errcode`, `errmsg`, and `errorCode` are removed from the business payload; nested business `code` and `status` retain their own meanings.

Business field tables and abbreviated business examples below describe `data`, unless explicitly labeled as a complete platform response. For example, a business `products` field is at HTTP `data.products`, and a business `data` array is at HTTP `data.data`. The research endpoints already had this outer envelope; no additional wrapper is added.

```json
{"code":0,"msg":null,"data":{}}
```

Metadata includes string `ts` (epoch milliseconds), string `cost` (elapsed milliseconds, not credits), `time`, and nullable `traceId`. Handle network/HTTP failures before the platform code; gateway failures may not be platform JSON. Keep the existing billing-header guidance separate from elapsed time.

## Response Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| total | integer | Number of records |
| data | array | List of detected policy-violating products (see below) |
| detectId | string | Detection record ID |
| columns | array | Rendering columns |
| costToken | integer | Tokens consumed |
| type | string | Rendering style |

### Fields of Each data Array Element

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| pdImgOssUrl | string | Image URL of the matched policy-violating product |
| cosine | number | Similarity between the submitted product and the policy-violating product |
| pdTitle | string | Title of the matched policy-violating product |
| pdTitleCHNCensored | string | Chinese title of the matched policy-violating product |

## Error Codes

HTTP 200 does not prove business success. Read only the numeric outer platform `code`: `0` succeeds and any other value fails. Show outer `msg`; never test removed provider codes or nested business `code` as the platform status. Authentication, permissions, balance, and validation failures may be platform errors even with HTTP 200; also handle non-2xx HTTP and non-JSON responses.

### Recovery guidance

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Authentication failed | HTTP 401 or authorized error: follow the authentication and credits guidance in SKILL.md. |
| Insufficient credits or balance | HTTP 402: follow the authentication and credits guidance in SKILL.md. |

## curl Examples

```bash
curl -X POST ${NEXSCOPE_PROXY_BASE}/api/v1/tools/research/ruiguan/gunPartsSearch \
  -H "Authorization: $nexscopeAGENT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"imageUrl": "https://example.com/product-image.jpg"}'
```

## Feedback API

> This endpoint is **separate** from the tool API above. Do not mix the two base URLs.

- **POST** `https://skill-api.nexscope.com/api/v1/public/feedback`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

```json
{
  "skillName": "nexscope-xxx-xxx",
  "sentiment": "POSITIVE",
  "category": "OTHER",
  "content": "Results were accurate, user was satisfied."
}
```

**Field rules:**
- `skillName`: Use this skill's `name` from the YAML frontmatter
- `sentiment`: Choose ONE — `POSITIVE` (praise), `NEUTRAL` (suggestion without emotion), `NEGATIVE` (complaint or error)
- `category`: Choose ONE — `BUG` (malfunction or wrong data), `COMPLAINT` (user dissatisfaction), `SUGGESTION` (improvement idea), `OTHER`
- `content`: Include what the user said or intended, what actually happened, and why it is a problem or praise
